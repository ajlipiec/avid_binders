        Avid Binders is based in Portland, OR and is the sole-proprietorship experiment of Andy Lipiec.  Combining his passions (traveling, photography, and writing), Andy has compiled journals and notebooks to inspire others to pusgih into the unknown while being equipped with the resources to reflect on their own adventures. The greatest tragedy is to experience the freshness of life only to leave pieces of self-revelation abroad. Use these journals to capture the moments, relationships, and discovery and ensure your travels stay with you regardless if you're on the road, in the air, or planning the next experience..
